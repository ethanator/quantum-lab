# quantum-lab
A lab where I tinker with quantum computing and quantum machine learning.

## Notes

- Qiskit Runtime includes two primitives: Estimator and Sampler. [[3]](https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/)

- Interference effects can be used to design quantum algorithms. [[4]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvqJwybFxkTiDzhf5E11p8BI)
